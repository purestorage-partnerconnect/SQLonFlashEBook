# SQLonFlashEBook
SQL Server In-Memory and Infrastructure Challenges EBook from Heraflux. 

Synopsis

The e-book from Pure Storage and Heraflux Technologies discuss how SQL Server's new in-memory functions In-Memory OLTP and columnstore indexes can increase the load on the infrastructure around it by a substantial margin. These two features are demonstrated with the included scripts from this repo to show sample usage of In-memory OLTP and columnstore indexes, and can be used to simulate a workload on your SQL Server environment.

Installation

To use these scripts to explore SQL Server in-memory technologies, create the databases with the DDL creation scripts, which also include table structures and stored procedures.
